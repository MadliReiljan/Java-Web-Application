# Java Web Application

I build a User Management module in a Java web application.

## What I learned

While building this application, I learned:

* Spring Boot Basics: Setting up a Spring Boot project and configuring essential properties.
* CRUD Operations: Developing Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
* Frontend Integration: Using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for building responsive and interactive user interfaces.
* Database Management: Configuring and connecting a MySQL database with Spring Boot, and working with MySQL Workbench for database interactions.
* Testing: Writing unit tests using JUnit 5 and AssertJ to ensure reliable data access layers.

## Tools and Techonologies

### Backend

* Spring Boot: For building the RESTful application.
* Spring Data JPA & Hibernate: For ORM and data persistence.
* MySQL: Used MySQL Community Server for data storage and MySQL Workbench for database management.
  
### Frontend

* Thymeleaf: For rendering dynamic content.
* Bootstrap & HTML5: For styling and responsive design.

### Testing
* JUnit 5 and AssertJ: For creating and running unit tests, particularly focused on data access layers.
### Software Used
* IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate: IDE for coding and running the application.
* Java Development Kit (OpenJDK): For compiling and executing the Java code.
* MySQL Workbench: For database design and querying.
